I guess it could be a bit more elegant but ok… 😊\nThe problem is, that I am running into a time-out:\nWhen the site loads, I am getting maybe 2 of 15 entries. \nWhen I click button10/Neu it executes the function again and I am getting more and more results.  \nI changed now from a async/await to a .then function but didn’t change much. \n\n Button11/Refresh does refresh the dataset connected to the table and is not changing anything.

        "content": "Looking for a bit of help creating an interactive dropdown list. \nTo avoid confusion, I'm not looking for a Menu Navigation Bar dropdown it has to be separate. \nIf this has already been asked, please point me in the right direction. \n\n \n \nI'm trying to create a dropdown list on my home page that links to other pages. \n- It needs 6 options (pages) inside of it.\n- These will then link to their own category pages. (see picture below)  \n\n \nWhen you click one of those options, I would like it to link to the page it relates to.\n\ni.e Adventure in the dropdown will link to the Adventure Tour page. \n\n\nHow did I get the dropdown? \nI turned on the Developer options and grabbed a dropdown box from the user input section. \nTo my understanding these dropdowns are usually for forms, but i've heard that they can be used for what I'm trying to do here. \n\nCurrently, I only have the design setup (pictured above) and you can click the items. But none of those items are linked to anything, as I don't know how to link them to a page or IF that's even possible. \n\nIs there some coding I can do to get this working? \nOr another option of a dropdown list/menu that I could work with?\n\n \n\nI appreciate any help on this, I've been staring at it for hours without any results.\n\n:)",
